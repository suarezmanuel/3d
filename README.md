### 3D renderer

<br/>

`%define "load" "hardcode"`

3d renderer where you "can" upload obj files and load them into view, and move around.

the 3d renderer is made from scratch using only the canvas' triangle drawing/filling functions.

i've implemented projection, lighting, rendering obj files (the ones from blender), a moving and rotating camera,
clipping for triangles that are outside the fov/screen or just too close that they get out of hand.

### player movement

you can move to the sides using the arrow keys,
rotate using `a`, `d` and go forwards, backwards with `w`, `s`.
